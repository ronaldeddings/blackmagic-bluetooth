- Configure JSX for React development
- Include DOM and ES2020+ libraries
- Enable module resolution for proper imports

### Security Considerations
- DFU and File Transfer services pose highest risk
- Implement proper access controls for critical services

- Create audit logging for all security-sensitive actions

### Performance Considerations
- Single-user focus allows simplified state management
- No need for complex scaling solutions
- Optimize for responsive UI during Bluetooth operations
- Implement proper loading states and progress indicators
