## Overview

Claude Code sub-agents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific SaaS business functions. Each sub-agent:

- Has its own context window separate from the main conversation
- Can be configured with specific tools it's allowed to use
- Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior
- Can be invoked explicitly or delegated to automatically

## Creating and Managing Sub-Agents

### Using the /agents Command

The recommended way to create and manage sub-agents is through Claude Code's built-in `/agents` command:

```bash
# In Claude Code interactive mode
/agents
```

This opens an interactive interface where you can:
- View all available sub-agents (built-in, user, and project)
- Create new sub-agents with guided setup
- Edit existing custom sub-agents
- Delete custom sub-agents
- See which sub-agents are active

### Quick Sub-Agent Creation Script

Create `.claude/scripts/create-saas-subagents.ts`:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun

## Best Practices

### Sub-Agent Design

1. **Start with Claude-Generated Agents**: Use `/agents` command and let Claude generate initial sub-agents, then customize
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each sub-agent should have one clear area of expertise
3. **Detailed System Prompts**: Include specific instructions, decision frameworks, and communication styles
4. **Appropriate Tool Access**: Only grant tools necessary for the agent's role
5. **Proactive Descriptions**: Use "PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" for automatic delegation

### Sub-Agent Usage

1. **Explicit Invocation**: Be specific when requesting a sub-agent (e.g., "Use the sales subagent to...")
2. **Chain for Complex Tasks**: Combine multiple sub-agents for comprehensive solutions
3. **Context Preservation**: Sub-agents have separate contexts, so provide necessary context
4. **Version Control**: Store project sub-agents in git for team collaboration
5. **Regular Updates**: Refine sub-agent prompts based on performance

### Performance Optimization

1. **Tool Selection**: Limit tools to reduce decision complexity
2. **Clear Instructions**: Specific prompts reduce token usage
3. **Batch Operations**: Delegate multiple related tasks together
4. **Context Management**: Use main Claude instance for coordination
5. **Monitor Usage**: Track which sub-agents are most effective
